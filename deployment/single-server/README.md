# Single-server deployment

This directory contains the tooling to deploy Open Notificaties against a single
server. It has been tested with Debian 9 and 10.

The application is deployed as docker containers, and the playbook will
set up all the required dependencies.

See [the docs](../../docs/installation/deployment/single_server.rst) on how to use this.
